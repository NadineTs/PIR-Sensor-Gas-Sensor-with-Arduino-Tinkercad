# README: Digital PIR Sensor and Analog Gas Sensor with Arduino (Tinkercad)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use both a digital PIR motion sensor and an analog gas sensor with an Arduino in the Tinkercad environment. The PIR sensor detects motion, while the gas sensor measures the concentration of gases in the environment. The Arduino will read values from both sensors and print the results to the Serial Monitor.

## Components Required

- **Arduino Uno R3**
- **Digital PIR Motion Sensor**
- **Analog Gas Sensor**
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **LED light**
- **Tinkercad Account** (for simulation)

## Sensor Descriptions

### 1. Digital PIR Motion Sensor

The **Passive Infrared (PIR) Motion Sensor** is designed to detect motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation. It is commonly used in security systems and automatic lighting controls. When a person or animal moves within its detection range, the PIR sensor outputs a digital signal indicating motion detection.

### 2. Analog Gas Sensor

The **Analog Gas Sensor** is used to measure the concentration of various gases in the environment. It provides an analog output voltage that corresponds to the gas concentration. This sensor is essential for air quality monitoring and safety applications.
